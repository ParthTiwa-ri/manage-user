# User Account Management App

This is a React application built to allow users to create and manage their accounts. It provides functionality for user registration, login, and account information management.

## Features

- User Registration: Allows new users to create an account by providing necessary information such as username, email, and password.
- User Login: Provides a login page for existing users to authenticate themselves and access their accounts.
- Account Management: Once logged in, users can view and edit their account information, such as username, email, and password.

## Technologies Used

- React v16+
- React Router: For managing navigation and routing within the application.
- React Context API: For managing global state such as user authentication status.
- Local Storage API: For persisting user authentication tokens or other necessary data locally in the browser.
- Iconscout Library: For accessing and using icons within the application for better visual representation.

## Data Persistence

User data is stored securely using the Local Storage API.
This ensures that even after refreshing the page or closing the browser, the user's account data remains saved locally.
The application retrieves this data upon initialization, allowing users to seamlessly continue their sessions without losing any information.

## Route Protection

To prevent unauthorized access to certain routes, the application implements route protection.
Users must be authenticated before accessing sensitive pages such as the account management page.
Unauthorized users attempting to access protected routes will be redirected to the home page.
