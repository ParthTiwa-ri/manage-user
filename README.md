# User Account Management App

This is a React application built to allow users to create and manage their accounts. It provides functionality for user registration, login, and account information management.

## Features

- **User Registration**: Allows new users to create an account by providing necessary information such as username, email, and password.
- **User Login:** Provides a login page for existing users to authenticate themselves and access their accounts.
- **Account Management:** Once logged in, users can view and edit their account information, such as username, email, and password.
- Cross platform

## Technologies Used:

- **React v16+**
- **React Router:** For managing navigation and routing within the application.
- **React Context API:** For managing global state such as user authentication status.
- **Local Storage API:** For persisting user authentication tokens or other necessary data locally in the browser.
- **Iconscout Library:** For accessing and using icons within the application for better visual representation.

## Non functional Feature

- **Route Protection:** Ensures only authenticated users access sensitive pages, redirecting unauthorized users.
- **Data Persistence:** Securely stores user data locally, maintaining session continuity across browser sessions.
